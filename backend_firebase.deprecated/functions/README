# Firebase functions

## Setup
You need the Java Development Kit (NOT just the Java Runtime Environment) to run Firebase functions locally.
Moreover my /usr/bin/java (result of `which java`) was screwed up so I needed the system to find the new Java installation
before the existing one (hence I prepend instead of append to PATH below).
On Mac:
```
brew install java
export PATH=/usr/local/opt/openjdk/bin:$PATH
```

## Compile the Typescript functions
We use Typescript so you need to compile it before testing locally.
```
npm run build
```

## Test locally (runs the above compile step) on emulator
Start the emulator:
```
./run_local_emulator.sh
```

Test HTTP functions after the emulator starts:
```
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/poggers-eb88a/us-central1/getAuthToken -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"data": {"rawMessage":"Please verify you own address 0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266 [epoch time = 1636703634815]", "signature": "0xb9ffebce7c940c919631b5da298945de1f9233874adcc3912ec785a5da23995102c3fb0a2d0a0712ebf104b93dcd7c4e9524bf973c062cdf1a1554943b1c00321c", "address": "0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266", "time": 1636703634815}}'
```
Note: The "data": {} needs to be in the request and response because Firebase API rules force it (particularly from the client app API).
